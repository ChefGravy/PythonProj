I am a self-taught developer. I developed this windows application using tkinter to act as a repository for financial data in order to help with building dashboards and financial reports. The frontend.py module contains the visuals and the backend.py module contains the SQLite queries. Take a look if you like and share your feedback on overall quality and please let me know if there is room for improvement.
