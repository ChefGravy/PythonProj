I developed this windows application using tkinter to act as a repository for financial data in order to help with building dashboards and financial reports. The table_query.py module was used to help me with building connections to SQLite to validate tables, columns, and PKs. The frontend.py module contains the visuals and the backend.py module contains the SQLite tables.
