I developed this application using mainly Tkinter and SQLite to act as a repository for financial data in order to help with building dashboards and financial reports. The frontend.py module contains the visuals and the backend.py module contains the SQLite queries. Please take a look and share your feedback on overall quality and kindly let me know where I can improve.
